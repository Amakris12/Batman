    <h1>Batman First set of Movies</h1>
    <p>Batman:If you’ve grown up in this golden age of superhero films, with a fresh, big-budget epic seemingly every month or two, it’s hard to appreciate quite how groundbreaking Tim Burton’s 1989 feature Batman felt. The first serious silver-screen take on the character, it elevated the superhero film in a way that had never been done before, not even by the Superman movies of the previous decade. Burton designed Gotham as a spooky Art Deco nightmare, slick and cool and full of danger, while Michael Keaton infused the role with a quiet seriousness it lacked in West’s days, and Jack Nicholson chewed the scenery as a terrifyingly comic version of the Joker. Today’s superhero epics couldn’t have come without this one paving the way.</p>
    <p>Batman Returns:If the first Burton Batman movie redefined the genre, this one exploded it into its full franchise potential. Indelibly Burton, it’s comical and weird, powered by the twin villain performances of Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman and Danny Devito as The Penguin, a role he was seemingly born to play. It’s a dark and brooding story, with The Penguin rising from the sewers to avenge his childhood abandonment by kidnapping all of Gotham’s firstborn children. While it might lack the gritty realism of Christopher Nolan’s later movies, it makes up for it with a gothic sensibility and wicked charm.</p>
    <p>Batman Forever:The ’90s powerhouse started to show some wear by the third film. Tim Burton departed as director, though he was credited as a producer, replaced in the chair by Joel Schumacher. Keaton was gone too, with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl instead. And a new pair of classic villains entered, with Tommy Lee Jones playing Harvey Dent, the Gotham District Attorney who would become the villainous Two-Face, and Jim Carrey in full Jim Carrey mode as The Riddler. Did this film have everything? Well, it had Seal singing “Kiss From A Rose” on the soundtrack, so I think that answers that. Jones and Carrey struggled to connect on the set of the film, with the serious-minded Jones reportedly telling the affable Carrey that “I cannot sanction your buffoonery”.</p>
    <p>Batman and Robin:If Batman Forever saw a transition beginning from the moody goth stylings of Tim Burton’s pair of movies, the fourth installation in the 1990s canon saw Joel Schumacher fully take the creative reins. The campiest incarnation since West’s original, Batman & Robin saw George Clooney don a Batsuit with prominent bat-nipples to join Chris O’Donnell’s Robin in battling Poison Ivy (Alicia Silverstone) and Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger, spewing catchphrases like a pull-string toy). The sequel was widely panned by critics and audiences alike, and brought an end to the franchise’s ‘90s incarnation, though it’s received some favorable reappraisal recently in light of Schumacher’s recent passing.</p>

    <h1>The Dark Knight Triology</h1>
    <p>Batman Begins:After an eight-year hiatus, it was going to take a fundamental rethinking of the story to bring the franchise back to life, and that’s exactly what Christopher Nolan did in this uncompromisingly dark and gritty origin story for the character. Pulling from several graphic novel sources, most notably Frank Miller’s 1987 comic Batman: Year One, this film stripped out the camp and excess for a dour, grounded sense of realism. Christian Bale plays a young Bruce Wayne as he becomes a costumed avenger in a bleak, horrific version of Gotham terror-stricken at the hands of Cillian Murphy’s mind-altering doctor The Scarecrow. The film would be eclipsed by its immediate successor, but it also made it possible</p>
    <p>The Dark Knight:The superhero movie to end all superhero movies. Nolan’s dark vision of Gotham takes full form in this taut psychological thriller, starring Heath Ledger in a performance that would not be released until after his untimely death. Ledger’s Joker was iconic, rendering all previous versions laughable — psychotic, menacing and cruel, in a genuinely terrifying way. It’s not just a paint-by-numbers heroes vs. villain fight: it’s a cleverly crafted epic with brilliant twists and turns throughout. The special effects are tremendous, the stakes are elevated, the performances are stunning — superhero movies simply do not get any better than this epic.</p>
    <p>The Dark Knight Rises:After Ledger’s passing, some speculated how a sequel in the Nolan series would even be possible, but he delivered with this impossibly bleak finale, which witnesses the entire city of Gotham held hostage under the threat of annihilation at the hands of the diabolical masked villain Bane, who plants a nuclear bomb underneath the city and destroys every route in or out of town. Many thought that it didn’t live up to the heights of its immediate predecessor, but it was a fitting coda to the Nolan trilogy, wrapping things up in a satisfactory, logical and consistent manner, a completed character circle.</p>

    <h1>DC Expanded Universe</h1>
    <p>Batman vs Superman:Did you ever wonder, “what if Bruce Wayne weren’t from Gotham City, but from South Boston instead?” Neither did I, but we still got the answer when Ben Affleck was cast to be the latest man behind the mask. The plot doesn’t make a great deal of sense, but here goes anyways: after the events of Man of Steel, the DC Extended Universe’s rebooted Superman film, Bruce Wayne sees Superman as a danger to the public, and sets out to stop him. Their rivalry is secretly fostered by the meddling of a Lex Luthor, here portrayed in a younger form by Jesse Eisenberg, one of the few bright spots in the otherwise poorly-received film.</p>
    <p>Justice League:Following the events of Batman v. Superman, [spoiler alert] Batman’s got to recruit a new team to help fill the void left by Superman’s death, and this sees the assemblage of Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman, Ezra Miller’s Flash and Jason Momoa’s Aquaman into the DC Universe’s primary superhero squad. The film underwent production difficulties, with director Zack Snyder stepping down for personal reasons during post-production and Joss Whedon taking over, a move criticized by many hardcore fans and leading to years of calls for the release of the so-called “Snyder Cut”, a campaign that will finally be fulfilled in 2021 when Snyder’s version of the film is re-released through HBO.</p>

    <h1>Tv shows</h1>
    <h1>Batman Animated series</h1>
    <p>This animated series conveys the dark mood of the original "Batman" comic books. Unlike the light action "Batman" show of the 1960s, Gotham City's Caped Crusader, Bruce Wayne, is sometimes moody. And Robin's alter ego, Dick Grayson, has a more-mature personality than in the original series.</p>
