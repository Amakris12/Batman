    <h1>The Riddler</h1>
    <p> Edward Nigma is a criminal mastermind who delights in rivaling Batman intellectually and has a strange compulsion to challenge Batman by leaving clues to his crimes in the form of riddles and puzzles. Despite his obsession, the Riddler is an extremely intelligent foe and has proven himself a capable arch-enemy of Batman, once even manipulating his entire rogues gallery in a mass conspiracy.</p>

    <h1>Two Face</h1>
    <p>Harvey Dent, formerly Gotham City's District Attorney and one of the Batman's closest friends and allies, who had half of his face horribly scarred in an acid attack that left him insane. He's completely obsessed with the number "2," duality, and fate. As such, all of the crimes that he commits revolve around the number "2." He carries a double-headed coin around with him that has one of the heads scarred, and he flips the coin before he makes any decisions involving a question of law and illegal activities; even when it would senselessly inconvenience him, sometimes surrendering when he otherwise could have escaped. Batman considers Harvey Dent's descent into madness to be one of his own greatest failures.</p>

    <h1>Mr.Freeze</h1>
    <p>Dr. Victor Fries was formerly a scientist and is an expert on cryonics. After his wife Nora Fries became ill, he tried to cryopreserve her until a cure was found for her disease. During the process, an accident caused his body to function only below freezing point, requiring him to wear a special self-contained refrigeration suit. He acts as an occasional ally to Batman, if he believes it will help save Nora. He uses similar ice technology for weapons.</p>

    <h1>Catwoman</h1>
    <p> Selina Kyle is one of Batman's most famous villains and love interests. She started as a criminal who wore a cat-themed costume and often operated as an expert burglar, but developed a love/hate relationship with Batman. For years, she skirted on the line between villain and antiheroine. However, over time she became more heroic and adopted the role of the guardian of Gotham City's crime-infested East End, though she still comes into conflict with Batman on rare occasions. In recent years, Batman and Catwoman's romantic relationship has developed to the point that she is a trusted ally of his</p>

    <h1>The League of Assisians</h1>
    <p>Ra's al Ghul: Ra's al Ghul is a centuries-old international eco-terrorist who leads the League of Assassins. He was one of the first to deduce the Batman's secret identity, and as such maintains an intimate relationship with him, going so far as to support an on/off relationship between Batman and al Ghul's own daughter, Talia. He lives in a state of somewhat immortality, thanks to the help of revitalizing Lazarus Pits. He has been alive for centuries and is incredibly intelligent and agile, having had time to train his mind and body to their absolute peaks. His name translates literally as "The Demon's Head," and he is credited with establishing the League of Assassins to further his goals. Ra's has two daughters and a son.</p>

    <p> Talia al Ghul: Talia is the daughter of Ra's al Ghul. Her father encouraged a relationship between Talia and Batman, desiring for Batman to marry his daughter in hopes of recruiting him as his successor. Talia admired Batman in his drive, determination, and nobility, but was always torn between him and the love for her terrorist father. In recent years, Talia has grown more antagonistic and established herself as a villain in her own right. She is the mother of Bruce Wayne's only biological</p>
